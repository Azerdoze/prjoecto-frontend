                <p>In the region of West Varsemia, near the Nakolotan border, the Kaastians live. A nation that inhabits in a network of canals and rivers, prospering and dominating the continent's commerce.</p>
                <p>The Kaastians are a diverse nation with focus on trade, doing business often with most of the nations. Currency was added in the continent by them and the various gold deposits, scattered throught the region, helped them become a strong power in the human kingdoms.</p>
                <p>This nation is ruled by an oligarchic counsil known as "Vermogend". This is made of ten people, each one a representative, a duke, of each of the most wealthy families in the nation. They discuss politics and commerce. Alas, This counsil works more as a symbol of power, making laws for the nations economical well being and not much else. The true power is in the families. Each family controls parcels of the cities, having complete jurisdiction inside these. The streets are patrolled by family owned guards and the kaastian army is no more than mercenary companies employed by wealthy merchants.</p>
                <p>In a society where the rich hold most of the power, the families fight and conspire between them, constantly searching for ways of weakening their rivals, in a unending game of intrigue and power. Their courts are avid of intrigue and conspiracy and their spies infamous throught all the land. Life in the court for a kaastian is very important and the kaastians believe that whoever holds the most knowledge, is the most powerful. And with the wealth generated by the commerce, the different houses are always trying to get the upper part of the deal in a neverending spyonage battle.</p>
                <p>The art of gunpowder, stolen from the Muabin, has long since been perfected by their engineers and academics and these "River Foxes" (how they are known throught the region) developed their firearms way smaller then the Muab Muskets. Today, these weapons, pistols, are part of the equipment of any soldier of spy.</p>
                <p>Military wise, the Kaastians prefer freedom of movement and coordination. Using practical light armor in battle. A typical kaastian soldier doesn't use more than a studded leather or a simple breastplate, an halberd, a rapier, two pistols and a pouch with ammunition.</p>
                <p>Religiously, this nation worships one entity, "The One God", Klaar. They see this being as a savior and redemptor of their people. In his temples, the poor are sheltered and taught. their priests spread the word and faith by the remaining kingdoms and it's frequent to see Klaar missionaries in other regions. The dukes themselves, family leaders, are zealous worshipers and work obsessively for the divine favour of their god.</p>
                <p>Due to the nations high commercial capacity, the kaastians harbour plenty of iluminated people from all the continent, from diverse cultural fields. Each court with a wide range of sages from different origins, training and improving the minds of their hired family, pushing for perfection the knowledge of the houses. This makes the Kaastians, especially the richest houses, some of the most culturally advanced in all the continent.</p>
                <p>Master of commerce, they keep wonderful diplomatic (and economical) relations with the Rubran, and good relationships in general with the rest of the nations in Varsemia. The canals and rivers that they dominate are stratigically good for, if the need arises, to stablish commercial deals with remote regions. Thus, there are commercial outposts positioned cleverly throught most of the continent, strengthning a house's power in the region. Nakolota is a good example of this. The kaastians are currently trying to explore the regions resources, much to the locals anger.</p>
                <p>Currently, the ten wealthiest families are: Van Orange, di Giobarti, de la Veja, der Fugger, da Gama, du Pont, de Burgos, of Tamzin, iz Morozov, and av Bender. Each family specializes in a particular field and has a distinctive fighting style and architecture.</p>
                <p>A typical kaastian measures between 1,70m to 2,10m tall. They are usually tall and slim, with hair normally light coloured, from light brown to pure blonde, using short hairstyles but extravagant and well groomed facial hairstyles. Their eyes are likewise light. They like to wear the colours that represent their houses.</p>

                description: `
                <p>At the heart of Varsemia lies the mountain range known as Salacia. In it, hidden amidst the vast peaks, cliffs and vales, lives the warrior tribes known as the Rubran Confederation, known for being specilized in guerilla warfare.</p>
                <p>The rubrans live in mazelike settlements made of stone known as <em>castros</em>. These settlements are filled with round shaped houses and walls, usually in higher ground, to make sure that it is easily defended. Outside of warfare, they are known for their solid swordsmithing and their viniculture. </p>
                <p>Each castro has a master house, where the <em>"Father"</em> lives, who is usually elected through merit. Each castro is usually a big family, with the exception of their main hub, Olísipo. Here, the Confederation leader, a chieftain known as <em>Viriatus</em>, has both political and military power, and coordenates the tribes in a trimestral gathering with the various chieftains.</p>
                <p>Weekly, the neighbouring castros meet to compete, doing several friendly skirmishes, that go from boxing matches, duels, but also clashes between all the warriors. In rubran lands, status is gained through merit, the ones who get the most in each castor, belong to a group known as the <em>table</em>, which is presided by the <em>"Father"</em>. A rather interesting thing about rubran society is that since each castro works like a single family, they are known to adopt people to bolster their ranks, thus it wouldn't be out of place to see foreigners as part of the <em>table</em> of a castro.</p>
                <p>These meritocrats are a nation that easily adapts against it's rivals and to the terrain. Even though they have their own religious pantheon, they are open to all religions. They have adapted the cretian judicial system, the discipline and military rigor of the Lamporian City-States, the natural mysticism of the Beveritan Tribes and have strong commercial ties with the Meynari, Minzao and Lao-Tse. Olísipo is by far one of the most diverse cultural pots in all the continent.</p>
                <p>The rubrans are known to exploit the vales of Salacia to develop bountiful vineyards and olive groves but also to produce strong cattle. Not only that, they are known to produce swords stronger than normal and they use all these as exports.</p>
                <p>Militarily, they work better in small groups, easier to manage and to prepare for ambushes. Masters of guerilla tactics, the rubrans have managed to keep their independance thanks to an exceptional knowledge of the land, and using it to their advantage. Their main rival is the cretian empire, whom wish to get Salacia's mineral veins.</p>
                <p>Their soldiers usually wear a leather armor, for ease of movement, a small wooden shield reinforced with metal (Caetra), a heavy bladed sword (Falcata), a dard made entirely of metal (Saunion), and a few throwing spears (Falarica). Chieftains wear chain shirts instead of leather armor and women usually serve a scout role.</p>
                <p>The Rubrans can be divided into four main tribes: the Luztineans, Iribeans, Cabatrians and Orutanians.</p>
                <p>Luztineans live amidst the highest peaks of the mountain range. They are quick on their feet and stubborn beyond measure, but they are known to be the best ambushers amidst rubrans.</p>
                <p>Iribeans live close to the rivers of the region. They are deadly slingers and expert sailors.</p>
                <p>Cabatrians live amidst the vales of Salacia. They have a deep understanding with horses and bulls and are expert in mounted combat. their animals are known to be more resilient than usual.</p>
                <p>Orutanians live on the outer edges of the region. They are known to be more reclusive and prefer the comfort of the few woods that exist in the land. They see the wolf as their spirit totem and some can even be seen with trained wolves.</p>
                <p>A typical rubran has between 1.50 and 1.80 metres tall. Men are usually stocky while women tend to have a slender body structure. Both have dark hair and prefer to have it long, tieing it during war times. Their eyes are dark or hazelnut and men like to have strong beards. While men dress with dark clothes and small cloaks, women prefer to dress with strong colors and long cloaks.</p>

                <p>Olísipo is a fascinating place where altars are made in the opening for most pantheons, inviting any passerby to be able to have a small sanctuary. Not only that, but the city has it's own international quarter, where a whole neighbourhood serves as the temporary lodgings for foreigners passing by the city.</p>
                <p>True to a tipical castro, the place is heavily fortified and the four clans work closely to ensure that it continues to be a safe gathering spot for whoever wants to be immersed in this unique place.</p>

                <p>In the Eastern side of Varsemia lies a power hungry empire. Naturally ambitious, these nation is almost always plotting expansions, trying to subjugate their enemies and making workforce of their fallen foes.</p>
                <p>The Empire of Cretus, or simply cretians, are quite the nation. Diplomatically very agressive and with a strong urge for conquer. Their government is managed by an elite, called the Senate, and the Caesar, choosen by the elite to function as an emperor. The Senate controls the juridical power, while Caesar controls the military. The economy is free in Cretus. Because of that, the wealthier tend to control a big part of the economy, making alliances and building an intricate monopoly.</p>
                <p>Justice in the human kingdoms originated here, in Cretus, and their juridical system is one of the most complete and advanced in the whole continent. The laws, lex in cretian, are kept behind the walls of huge buildings, called Curiae, where citizens are also judged (by jurisconsultus) for crimes inside the empire's territory. Justice is kept in the streets by the Pretoriani. Soldiers highly skilled and trained, that answer directly to the emperor and make sure that the Lex is respected. The highest punishment in the empire is death by crucification.</p>
                <p>Religion is to the cretians a complicated matter. the Caesar decides which is the official religion of the empire, but since they are almost always trying to conquer territory, it leads to a lot of different religions inside their territory. This leads to a lot of quarrels by fanatics or xenophobes, which are quenched by mass crucifications. The cretians by default have their own pantheon and massive temples can be found throughout their territory.</p>
                <p>Well known for their oppressive instincts, the cretians are famous for their harshness towards the conquered. From crucifications to imposing their beliefs and religion, they have become infamous for their xenophoby. Truth be told, they try to convince the conquered of the cultural and juridical advantages of the "cretianization", making those that adapt free citizens of the empire. With this method, they ensure the empire keeps itself culturally strong.</p>
                <p>Diplomatically, Cretus has good relations with the Lampa states. They have healthy commercial ties with the Kaastians and they currently have an alliance through marriage with the Sephs. Their coat of arms is a golden eagle, itºs wings wide open, inside a white globe, with a red background.</p>
                <p>Cretian citizens have controversial leisure habits. The abuse of slavery, not just for households, but also to fight in massive arenas is just the tip of the iceberg. Orgies are common throughout the rich and pedophilia is seen as an accepted practice. These make some nations see them as an excessive and corrupt way of living.</p>
                <p>A typical cretian has between 1.60m and 1.80m of height. They usually have dark and short hair and clean shaved. Their eyes match their hair. A citizen in it's daily life does not wear much more than a toga and some sandals.</p>

                code: "GC",
                shortdescription: `Expert and ferocious forestmen who whom love nothing more than their freedom.`,
                description: `
                <p>The Gernian Confederation, or simply Gernum, is a group of tribes that lived together in beveritan territory. During the cretian occupation, these tribes fled and hid in the dense flora of the Northeastern part of the Beveritan Woods, in Varsemia.</p>
                <p>The Confederation gain notoriety when, short after the cretian ocupation, the invading army knew about the gernian resistance and drafted an army to wipe them out of their forests. No cretian man ever returned. The battle, known as the Battle of Apfelkralle, is nowadays considered one of the cretian empire’s biggest military vexations. It is said that the gernian general, Radagolf Nachtblut, better known in common as Radagolf of the Nocturnal Blood, and a group of guerrilla fighters infiltrated the cretian army’s ranks, using cretian uniforms and speaking perfect cretian. The ambush took place on a narrow road that led to the nearby settlement, situated in a valley amidst thick woods. It is said it was raining buckets that day. Reports say huge balls of burning hay rolled down the valley, colliding with the surprised cretian soldiers, whose mobility was hampered by the thick slough the road had become. Roars then started coming down the valley, the power of the united gernian tribes running towards the enemy. When the army tried to fight back, their ranks were already being thinned by Radagolf and his turncoats.</p>
                <p>Up to this day, almost no nation can boast about wiping a whole cretian division. Even today, that company’s banner, a golden eagle, lies in the gernian community, displayed as a trophy for it’s people.</p>
                <p>The Confederation has shown to be shrewd diplomats, who quickly forged an alliance with the nations of Noerican culture (Beveritan, Krin and Gernum) agaisnt the invaders. Their leader, Ataulf, the Old Wolf, is a tenacious man, quick witted and capable strategist. Currently, he works as the leader of the alliance, coordinating the joint armies movement and continuing to gamble on ambushes to cause dents on enemy forces.</p>
                <p>Even though they found shelter in the Northeast of the region, the confederation doesn’t have their borders safe. While the conflict drags on to the South, news from the North arrive about a tribe from Western Ghobi, the Chunoi, who’s invading the region of Varsemia, leaving behind nothing but death and destruction.</p>
                <p>A group of mixed tribes of zealous warriors, dauntless and expert in fighting in dense woods, the gernian don’t fear any superpower. Using the forests as their hideout and the night as their ally, these are exalted guerrilla fighters, capable of landing devastating ambushes. With each tribe having a role in their confederation, as a whole they are a capable army. One of the tribes, the Hari, idolize the night and anoint themselves in black paint before a battle. Another tribe, the Siones, are specialized in river warfare, building sturdy rowing boats for quick amphibious assaults.</p>
                <p>Military wise, ther gernian armies are composed of both men and women. Their soldiers wear little armor for more mobility and the prefer to wield on heavy weapons, mostly two handed, for more impact. The ones that wield spears are usually the defensive force, using a short spear and a crude shield and changing to an axe or sword when the enemies penetrate the spears range. Not only night ambush specialists, they are known for the barbarism of it’s warriors. Capable of entering true states of unbridled rage on the battlefield, these warriors are strong in psychological warfare and, using the night and forest to their advantage and covered with bear, elk or wolf mantles, they spread panic between the ambushed, that while surprised think they are being attacked by fantastical creatures.</p>
                <p>With an archaic economy, the Gernum Confederation relies strongly on livestock and hunting, allowing them to be constantly on the move. They dress themselves with animal skins, wash themselves in rivers, and have a diet based in milk and meat. Wine is forbidden in their society and trade is only made during the spoils of war, so little to no exportation.</p>
                <p>Although slavery is not common, some chiefs practice it, gathering them for human sacrifices in honor of the gods. Gernum have a diversified pantheon, made of a mix of gods from the Noerican culture. Their altars are small and easy to dismantle, favoring glades to build them.</p>
                <p>Even though wine is forbidden, other spirits are not and they are known for being skilled in the art of beer brewing. Their men can be identified by a hairstyle known as the “Gernian Tie”, that according to them, distinguishes a free man from a slave, thus serving as a symbol of social status. The hairstyle consists of a knot in the hair, on the right side of the head. Chiefs frequently use more elaborate versions.</p>
                <p>Their flag and banner is a depiction of three men in the center, their chins pointing towards the center, forming a union with their beards, under a brown background.</p>
                <p>A typical citizen of the gernian confederation has between 1.70 to 2.00 meters tall. They have light skin with long hair, with the right side usually tied. The hair varies between darker colors. Men wear thick beards, with higher hierarchy using ornaments, like links, and braided beards. Women are simple, they don’t use makeup and dress the same as men. Only in ceremonies they dress themselves with long and colorful dresses and braided hair.</p>

                hubdescription: `
                <p>On the shore of to the Widowlore Inner Sea, and part of the northern part of the Pinus Silvae woods, the gernian main hub of Kieferrille serves as a strategic point for the gernians to launch swift strikes against the Cretian Empire, but also to delve in seafaring trade with the neighbouring nations, like the beveritans.</p>        
                <p>The settlement is part of the Sion tribe, but all tribes are welcome here. While the gernian are not know for their exceptional trade skills, the hub still functions as their main port and it's common to see merchants from the inner sea plying their trade here.</p>
                <p>Besides sea route, there really isn't a road towards Kieferrille, making it hard for a non gernian to be able to reach it by land. But the gernian know their way around a forest and the Fort Niedrigschild and the Heiligmeite settlement are close enough and serve as strategic places of interest for the economy of the hub.</p>

                description: `
                <p>In the north west of Varsemia, a group of different nations with the same culture joined a complex alliance system.</p>
                <p>Formerly tribal men with strong society values, these folk, known as beveritan, have evolved enough so that each nation became unique on it's own.</p>
                <p>Besides the strong alliances that make this independent states united, this cultural group can be subdivided into four smaller cultural groups. The Continental, Insular, Peninsular and Eastern.</p>
                <p>The Avenai, Buori and Noeri are the "continental beveritans". They are usually tall, strong, posessing light colored hair and eyes. These nations governments are republics.</p>
                <p>the "insular beveritans" live in the Island of Name, in Inner Sea of Widowlore. They are made of Bertians and Pieni. Bertians live on the bottom half while Pieni on the upper half. They are seen as the palest of the beveritans. Each of these nations is governed through a Monarchy.</p>
                <p>The Keltirian and Galatian make the "peninsular beveritans". They reside on the Tarhcan Peninsula, with Galatians living on the southern part and Keltirians on the northern. They have dark hair and dark eyes, and they live in citadel-states, on top of hills.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the Eastari make the "eastern beveritans". They live on the eastern part of rocky desert of Lapidibus Agri. They have a rosed skin and light blue eyes, and are governed through cantons, or subregional management.</p>
                <p>A typical beveritan heights between 1,70m to 2,00m, and likes to have her hair braided.</p>
                
                <h3>Avenai</h3>
                <p>The Avenai live in the cities of Bibracte, Gergovia and Alesia, and it's surroundings.</p>
                <p>They are seen as prized metalworkers throughout the land, supplying most of the confederation and booming their local economy, thus it's citizens are considered wealthy for beveritan standards.</p>
                <p>The Avenai also are a strong diplomatic force, not only in the confederation, but also in the continent, thought they have a harder time interacting with tribals.</p>
                <p>The boar is sacred to this nation. These animals grow to considerable size and are sturdier than average, making the Avenai fond of using these animals as good companions, even as mounts.</p>
                <p>Military wise, they are known for their heavy spearmen. Trained since youth, the folk of Avena master the art of spear fighting until they become deadly combatatants.</p>
                <p>Their current republican leader is a charismatic and cunning warrior named Vergincorix.</p>
                
                <h3>Buori</h3>
                <p>The cities of Telamon, Placentia and Mutina, and it's surroundings make the land of the Buori.</p>
                <p>They are governed in their republic by a strong, passionate warrior called Bellovesus.</p>
                <p>This nation is known for it's less noble practices and thus seen badly between other beveritan nations.</p>
                <p>The fact that they are known raiders, plundering both nearby and distant realms, and also by the fact they attack in considerable numbers, makes their ill-reputation just. Not only this, but their warrior society praises to fight naked in battle, which intimidates even more their foes.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the folk of Buor are known as skilled herders, praising above all their aurochs. These animals are quite useful in their society and Buori see them as sacred, even charging to war with them.</p>
                <p>Due to their more barbaric ways, the Buori have an oral education system, thus most of it's inhabitants are illiterate.</p>
                
                <h3>Noeri</h3>
                <p>In the lands of the cities of Bagacum, Fanum Martis, and Gemimniacum, live the Noeri.</p>
                <p>This nation is governed through a republic by a zealous and pious man known as Boduognatus.</p>
                <p>The Noeri are known for being extreme in their ways. They live on a very strict code of conduit, the Noeri Way, which makes them forfeit most luxuries and despise any type of commerce. Thus, they live in a community way.</p>
                <p>Their Warriors are known for being fearless and unrelenting, capable of continuing against the face of danger for large amounts of time. That and when the summons are made, their armies swarm the battlefield, making them a respectable force.</p>
                <p>Even with their codes and laws, Noeri are still barbaric, with a oral education system, making most of it's denizens illiterate.</p>
                <p>They have the particularity of producing excellent skalds, or savage bards. These performers master the art of the horn blowing and are known to bolster the zealous warriors morale to impressive heights.</p>
                
                <h3>Bertians</h3>
                <p>In the southern side of the Island of Name, exists the Kingdom of Bertia, emcompassing all the bottom half of the island and it's three cities Gwynedd, Venta Icenorum and Eboracum.</p>
                <p>Each of the it's cities is autonomous, with a ruler responsible for each city. The strategist and morally right Lucius Castus governs Eboracum. The proud and rancorous Boudicea rules Venta Icenorum, and Cadwallon, a conservative, but wise man, is in charge of Gwynedd.</p>
                <p>The bertians are known for their chivalric lifestyle. Always trying to behave nobly and respectfully, even to the ones they might despise. They are also fond of jousting and court life.</p>
                <p>Contrary to most other beveritans, they don't worship beveritan gods. Instead, they worship Druidism, seeing druids and their mysterious ways as guides of the threads of fate. They also see the elk as a holy creature.</p>
                <p>Bertians are expert farmers, knowing full well how to exploit a fertile land. Not only that, but due to higher education they are as good diplomats as the Avenai.</p>
                <p>In battle, they swarm the fields with heavy cavalry, the best on the confederation, charging their enemy with fearsome war elks to devastating effect.</p>
                
                <h3>Pieni</h3>
                <p>In the northern side of the Island of Name, encompassing the cities of Circinn, Fotla and Fortriu, live tribal Pieni.</p>
                <p>Each city is ruled by a monarch. A giant of a man, Drest, son of Erp, rules Circinn. the city of Fotla is in charge of Nechtan "The Great" Celcamoth, a surprisingly small, but fierce leader. The city of Fortriu is overseen by Gartnait II, a stocky and fat genius.</p>
                <p>The Pieni are the main ambushers of the beveritan force. They are experts in studying the area and employing fear tactics to gain the upper hand against their foes.</p>
                <p>They charge their enemies with abbadon, running naked from their hideout, their bodies covered in blue and white paint, making a disturbing visage for their unfortunate enemies.</p>
                <p>The Pieni are also well known bounty hunters. With a peculiar skill of being deadly with slashing weapons.</p>
                <p>Since they have an oral education, most of it's citizens are illiterate.</p>
                
                <h3>Keltirian</h3>
                <p>Deep in the northern side of the Tarhcan Peninsula resides the micro kingdom of Keltiria. This small reign is made of three cities (Kontebakom-Bel, Sekaisa and Okilis) and its surrounding lands, with Okilis as it's capital.</p>
                <p>They are governed by a cunning and old warrior king named Carus. Carus was initially from a city called Segeda, though that city was razed many years ago. Nonetheless people still call him Carus of Segeda.</p>
                <p>The Keltirians are known for their shrewd diplomatic skills with their more isolated neighbours, the Galitian.</p>
                <p>In warfare, these warriors are master ambushers and can navigate easily through mountainous terrain. They are master throwers, specialized in Javelin throwing.</p>
                <p>With rocky landscapes as home, these proud people became adept and skilled in animal husbandry, and they are known to train deadly bulls for war.</p>
                <p>Like most beveritans, they have an oral tradition, thus most of the population is illiterate.</p>
                
                <h3>Galatian</h3>
                <p>Geographically isolated from the rest of the confederation, the Galitian reside in the Mountain region of the southern side of the Tarhcan Peninsula. This natural isolation has made them wary and suspicious of outside influence, making it hard for foreigner to be trusted by the local populace. This natural isolation made the Galatian a natural survivor, striving in one on one situations and combat.</p>
                <p>Born and raised on the difficult terrain of the mountain region, these sturdy characters are prodigious when it comes to live and fight in mountainous terrain.</p>
                <p>The tribe of Galatia is governed through a War Council of three men. Each the ruler of the three main hilltop citadels of Arrotrebae, Albion and Lemavi.</p>
                <p>Known for their sturdy and resistant builds, the galatian make good foot soldiers and they shout the name of their patron deity, Bandua, the God of War, while charging their enemies.</p>
                <p>Known for their ovine culture, of which they use it for food and textiles, the Galatian specially breed strong rams, these big ovines are strong enough to carry a man on itºs back, and some soldiers even use them has charge cavalry.</p>
                <p>Due to their oral traditions, most of the population is illiterate.</p>
                
                <h3>Eastari</h3>
                <p>The Eastari live where the Lake Widowlore ends and the rocky desert of Lapidibus Agri begins.</p>
                <p>The region is governed through cantons, centered in farmstead citadels, three in total. Ancyra, overshadowing River Rijk, is governed by Brennus. Pessinus, in the center, with sights on Lake Widowlore, is governed by Liutarus. And Tavium, ruling over river Verkeer, is governed by Leonnarius.</p>
                <p>Living in an arid environment is harsh, with not much natural resources.

                description: `
                <p>The South of Varsemia once belonged to a kingdom of stoic and determined warriors, created since childhood to be the perfect war machines. A kingdom, that even when the Great Deluge came and turned their lust lands into scattered isles, they stood strong and united. Even when the Cretian Empire started their expansionism, The kingdom stood tall. Even outnumbered, they managed to defend their land from the invaders. That is, until the Battle of Spiti, where, even after being victorious, the Lampa king Pirhus fell in battle.</p>
                <p>With the fall of the king and without successor to the throne, the old Lampa Kingdom saw itself without a leader to guide it. Thus, it was decided by the various political parties to create a reunion between the leaders of the archipelagos major cities. Akeros, Corkos, Thebae, Santea e Lamporia. Here it was agreed that the old kingdom would be divided by the different isles, with the loyalists to the old kingdom staying in the isle of Lamporia. Thus the Island nations of Makeronia, Corkosia, Santea and Thebae were born. Most recently a new city-state, Bacinia, was formed on the Varsemian Peninsula and added to the confederation.</p>
                <p>A typical citizen from the Isle Nations of Varsemia is between 1,60m to 1,90m tall. They usually have a well defined body, due to harsh and continuous training.

                <h3>Lamporia</h3>
                <p>The reformed Lampa kingdom, now officially Lamporian City-State, is situated in the isle of the same name. It’s a shadow of it’s glorious past. Still, they stand proud and with the same stoic beliefs. These folk live in a diarchy, where two people govern as rulers, each from a different family, but having equal power. The responsibilities of these rulers are fundamentally religious and military, with them working above all as generals.</p>
                <p>The judicial power resides on a group of oficials called Ephors and a counsil of elders, known as Gerousia. This council is made of twenty eight elders older then sixty springs. They are elect for life and they are usually of royal blood. It’s up to them, between many decisions, for the country to participate or not in wars.</p>

The Lamporian women can’t marry early, only after twenty winters. This is to assure that she is strong and healthy during labor, thus producing healthy children.

Decisions are made by an elite group, masters of the arts and knowledge, known as the Golden Assembly or locally as Chrysi Ecclesia, and are elected periodically by the adult male population, whose parents were born in Santea (so Pathes). The Assembly then elects between themselves a leader, who governs in periods of five years, that can be renewed if re-elected.

The old fort of Kerkyra quickly became an important crossroad between western and eastern kingdoms. The villages of Edisea and Corinea, once just normal fishing towns, saw their harbours become filled with boats coming from everywhere bringing exotic goods and trade. The freedom of movement, even for their former enemies, saw multiculturalism and free religion prosper, as more and more denizens of the kingdoms seeked to make a new life there.</p>
                <p>Soon, the bursting new society saw the inevitable, they had become too big to be just small territory controlled overseas. In a politically mastered coup that saw no blood spilled, the lords of the peninsula took complete control and installed the leader of Kerkyra, Diodocus, as their monarch. This coup was badly seen with the Isles Confederation, who saw the region as important economically, still they couldn’t face it against the overwhelming support Diodocus gathered.</p>
                <p>Diodocus first order was to rename the citadel of Kerkyra to Baciria, thus the City-State of Baciria was born.</p>
                <p>Bacirians are an interesting breed. They are a mix society with the fundamentals of the Lamporian culture still intact, but the contact and exposition to other cultures, specially eastern ones, developed something unique. Aesthetically, their cities are still very lamporian, but it’s denizens have more meynari descendants than any other nation. This multiculturalism led to free religion, something rare in the human kingdoms. Not only that, but this cultural pot made them become curious about the world and they quickly adopted tactics and training to make them better and scouting terrain, thus making this nation good wayfarers.</p>
                <p>Bacirian military reflects this multiculturalism. Their infantry is composed by finely trained and disciplined hoplites, martial heritage from the Islands Confederation. Their cavalry was trained by mercenary chunoi and ulnucs who taught them the fine skill of horseback archery. Also, their cavalry, with Meynari and Nahjian influences, managed to domesticate and employ as cohorts and mounts more exotic animals, like Elephants and Rhinos. To finalize this exotic mix of cavalry units is the introduction of a new breed of camels, the Bacirian Camels. These are bulkier and more resistant than their cousins, with strong fur that protects them from harsh environments. These animals are used to cross difficult terrain, making them ideal for the Bacirian caravans to go to Far East to trade goods.</p>
                <p>While a typical Bacirian has the traditional lamporian genetic traits they have adopted an Eastern sense of fashion. Their eyes are usually eyelined, they use long turbans to cover most of their faces and they use a mixture of eastern and western weaponry.</p>

                <p>In the region of West Varsemia, near the Nakolotan border, the Kaastians live. A nation that inhabits in a network of canals and rivers, prospering and dominating the continent's commerce.</p>
                <p>The Kaastians are a diverse nation with focus on trade, doing business often with most of the nations. Currency was added in the continent by them and the various gold deposits, scattered throught the region, helped them become a strong power in the human kingdoms.</p>
                <p>This nation is ruled by an oligarchic counsil known as "Vermogend". This is made of ten people, each one a representative, a duke, of each of the most wealthy families in the nation. They discuss politics and commerce. Alas, This counsil works more as a symbol of power, making laws for the nations economical well being and not much else. The true power is in the families. Each family controls parcels of the cities, having complete jurisdiction inside these. The streets are patrolled by family owned guards and the kaastian army is no more than mercenary companies employed by wealthy merchants.</p>
                <p>In a society where the rich hold most of the power, the families fight and conspire between them, constantly searching for ways of weakening their rivals, in a unending game of intrigue and power. Their courts are avid of intrigue and conspiracy and their spies infamous throught all the land. Life in the court for a kaastian is very important and the kaastians believe that whoever holds the most knowledge, is the most powerful. And with the wealth generated by the commerce, the different houses are always trying to get the upper part of the deal in a neverending spyonage battle.</p>
                <p>The art of gunpowder, stolen from the Muabin, has long since been perfected by their engineers and academics and these "River Foxes" (how they are known throught the region) developed their firearms way smaller then the Muab Muskets. Today, these weapons, pistols, are part of the equipment of any soldier of spy.</p>
                <p>Military wise, the Kaastians prefer freedom of movement and coordination. Using practical light armor in battle. A typical kaastian soldier doesn't use more than a studded leather or a simple breastplate, an halberd, a rapier, two pistols and a pouch with ammunition.</p>
                <p>Religiously, this nation worships one entity, "The One God", Klaar. They see this being as a savior and redemptor of their people. In his temples, the poor are sheltered and taught. their priests spread the word and faith by the remaining kingdoms and it's frequent to see Klaar missionaries in other regions. The dukes themselves, family leaders, are zealous worshipers and work obsessively for the divine favour of their god.</p>
                <p>Due to the nations high commercial capacity, the kaastians harbour plenty of iluminated people from all the continent, from diverse cultural fields. Each court with a wide range of sages from different origins, training and improving the minds of their hired family, pushing for perfection the knowledge of the houses. This makes the Kaastians, especially the richest houses, some of the most culturally advanced in all the continent.</p>
                <p>Master of commerce, they keep wonderful diplomatic (and economical) relations with the Rubran, and good relationships in general with the rest of the nations in Varsemia. The canals and rivers that they dominate are stratigically good for, if the need arises, to stablish commercial deals with remote regions. Thus, there are commercial outposts positioned cleverly throught most of the continent, strengthning a house's power in the region. Nakolota is a good example of this. The kaastians are currently trying to explore the regions resources, much to the locals anger.</p>
                <p>Currently, the ten wealthiest families are: Van Orange, di Giobarti, de la Veja, der Fugger, da Gama, du Pont, de Burgos, of Tamzin, iz Morozov, and av Bender. Each family specializes in a particular field and has a distinctive fighting style and architecture.</p>
                <p>A typical kaastian measures between 1,70m to 2,10m tall. They are usually tall and slim, with hair normally light coloured, from light brown to pure blonde, using short hairstyles but extravagant and well groomed facial hairstyles. Their eyes are likewise light. They like to wear the colours that represent their houses.</p>`,

                <p>The Kaastian capital is also known for it's bipolar nature. while the docks and the outer rims of the city might be a cultural phenomenon, the inner city is home for the Kaastians and they make that quite clear.

                <p>In the region of West Varsemia, near the Nakolotan border, the Kaastians live. A nation that inhabits in a network of canals and rivers, prospering and dominating the continent's commerce.</p>
                <p>The Kaastians are a diverse nation with focus on trade, doing business often with most of the nations. Currency was added in the continent by them and the various gold deposits, scattered throught the region, helped them become a strong power in the human kingdoms.</p>
                <p>This nation is ruled by an oligarchic counsil known as "Vermogend". This is made of ten people, each one a representative, a duke, of each of the most wealthy families in the nation. They discuss politics and commerce. Alas, This counsil works more as a symbol of power, making laws for the nations economical well being and not much else. The true power is in the families. Each family controls parcels of the cities, having complete jurisdiction inside these. The streets are patrolled by family owned guards and the kaastian army is no more than mercenary companies employed by wealthy merchants.</p>
                <p>In a society where the rich hold most of the power, the families fight and conspire between them, constantly searching for ways of weakening their rivals, in a unending game of intrigue and power. Their courts are avid of intrigue and conspiracy and their spies infamous throught all the land. Life in the court for a kaastian is very important and the kaastians believe that whoever holds the most knowledge, is the most powerful. And with the wealth generated by the commerce, the different houses are always trying to get the upper part of the deal in a neverending spyonage battle.</p>
                <p>The art of gunpowder, stolen from the Muabin, has long since been perfected by their engineers and academics and these "River Foxes" (how they are known throught the region) developed their firearms way smaller then the Muab Muskets. Today, these weapons, pistols, are part of the equipment of any soldier of spy.</p>
                <p>Military wise, the Kaastians prefer freedom of movement and coordination. Using practical light armor in battle. A typical kaastian soldier doesn't use more than a studded leather or a simple breastplate, an halberd, a rapier, two pistols and a pouch with ammunition.</p>
                <p>Religiously, this nation worships one entity, "The One God", Klaar. They see this being as a savior and redemptor of their people. In his temples, the poor are sheltered and taught. their priests spread the word and faith by the remaining kingdoms and it's frequent to see Klaar missionaries in other regions. The dukes themselves, family leaders, are zealous worshipers and work obsessively for the divine favour of their god.</p>
                <p>Due to the nations high commercial capacity, the kaastians harbour plenty of iluminated people from all the continent, from diverse cultural fields. Each court with a wide range of sages from different origins, training and improving the minds of their hired family, pushing for perfection the knowledge of the houses. This makes the Kaastians, especially the richest houses, some of the most culturally advanced in all the continent.</p>
                <p>Master of commerce, they keep wonderful diplomatic (and economical) relations with the Rubran, and good relationships in general with the rest of the nations in Varsemia. The canals and rivers that they dominate are stratigically good for, if the need arises, to stablish commercial deals with remote regions. Thus, there are commercial outposts positioned cleverly throught most of the continent, strengthning a house's power in the region. Nakolota is a good example of this. The kaastians are currently trying to explore the regions resources, much to the locals anger.</p>
                <p>Currently, the ten wealthiest families are: Van Orange, di Giobarti, de la Veja, der Fugger, da Gama, du Pont, de Burgos, of Tamzin, iz Morozov, and av Bender. Each family specializes in a particular field and has a distinctive fighting style and architecture.</p>
                <p>A typical kaastian measures between 1,70m to 2,10m tall. They are usually tall and slim, with hair normally light coloured, from light brown to pure blonde, using short hairstyles but extravagant and well groomed facial hairstyles. Their eyes are likewise light. They like to wear the colours that represent their houses.</p>`,

                <p>During the 12th century, during the Cretian occupation, the empire grew so large that management became quite difficult. The ongoing civil unrest from the conquered did not made it easy for the empire as well. As a result, Emperor Constance I, the Enlightened,decided to divide the Empire in two, with Cretus controlling the Varsemian side and the newly founded Zancium the Nahjari side.</p>
                <p>Zancium ended up influenced by the neighbouring countries. Architecture mainly from the Sephs and the old Lampa empire. Their military, heavily inspired on the Armatians, use heavy chainmails and barded cavalry, creating an army of anonymous, cold, merciless and disciplined soldiers (known as cataphracts), combining the best of two worlds. Constance I, was always a fan of the Kaastian pantheon and quickly made it the official religion of the new empire. All this changes made Zancium achieve some international recognition, and the word of cultural freedom in it's borders quickly attracted flocks of great minds to it's courts.</p>
                <p>Zancium, also known as the Cretian Empire of the East, or Nahjari Cretian Empire, Is currently ruled by Emperor Horace IV, the Truthful, son of Constance I. The empire is facing pressure from several sides, but mainly from the najhani nations of Muab, Armatia and Barcagenia. Even so, their strong walls have so far kept any enemies at bay and the cities blossom with the internationality of it's citizens, bringing currency and wisdom to it's walls.</p>
                <p>Having such powerful minds in the courts can be dangerous, tough. The court has become a nest of snakes, constantly vying for power. Court intrigue is intense and deadly. People fall from grace with words or worse. So the rich have their own bodyguards, and even still that could not be enough.</p>
                <p>While the court might be savage, commerce is another beast. With routes heavily guarded, but with merchants flowing in, and the spoils of the recent war, Zancium has become a pivotal economy in the region. this made the merchant-class thrive to the point of hiring companies of mercenaries to defend their lands. The emperor himself has done the same, and the elite of the mercenaries, a group of heavily disciplined Tvor, is known has the Varangui Guard.</p>
                <p>A typical zancian is similar to a cretian. They have between 1.60m and 1.80m of height. They usually have dark and short hair and clean shaved. Their eyes match their hair. A citizen in it's daily life does not wear much more than a toga and some sandals.</p>`,

                <p>Religiously, this nation worships one entity, "The One God", Klaar. They see this being as a savior and redemptor of their people. In his temples, the poor are sheltered and taught. their priests spread the word and faith by the remaining kingdoms and it's frequent to see Klaar missionaries in other regions. The dukes themselves, family leaders, are zealous worshipers and work obsessively for the divine favour of their god.</p>
                <p>Due to the nations high commercial capacity, the kaastians harbour plenty of iluminated people from all the continent, from diverse cultural fields. Each court with a wide range of sages from different origins, training and improving the minds of their hired family, pushing for perfection the knowledge of the houses. This makes the Kaastians, especially the richest houses, some of the most culturally advanced in all the continent.</p>
                <p>Master of commerce, they keep wonderful diplomatic (and economical) relations with the Rubran, and good relationships in general with the rest of the nations in Varsemia. The canals and rivers that they dominate are stratigically good for, if the need arises, to stablish commercial deals with remote regions. Thus, there are commercial outposts positioned cleverly throught most of the continent, strengthning a house's power in the region. Nakolota is a good example of this. The kaastians are currently trying to explore the regions resources, much to the locals anger.</p>
                <p>Currently, the ten wealthiest families are: Van Orange, di Giobarti, de la Veja, der Fugger, da Gama, du Pont, de Burgos, of Tamzin, iz Morozov, and av Bender. Each family specializes in a particular field and has a distinctive fighting style and architecture.</p>
                <p>A typical kaastian measures between 1,70m to 2,10m tall. They are usually tall and slim, with hair normally light coloured, from light brown to pure blonde, using short hairstyles but extravagant and well groomed facial hairstyles. Their eyes are likewise light. They like to wear the colours that represent their houses.</p>`,

                description:`
                <p>When the rubran fell to the cretian armies, the prestigious Barcagid family fled to Najha, swearing vengeance. Seizing the seas created by the Great Deluge, they stablished themselves in the southern coast of Najha and it's archipelago. The family quickly began to shelter war refugees, giving them a new life, and with this, they grew as a nation. With years passing by, they became a bulwark of resistance and a prestigious nation, rivaling the cretian empire. Thus, the Barcagenian nation was born, made of collective society who's goal is to end the Cretian imperiliasm.</p>
                <p>The barcagenians are governed by a gerontocratic republic, a selected council of elders elected every year by the diverse barcagenans houses. On the daily basis, the districts of Barcago, the capital, and other small cities are usually led by one or more oligarchs. These currently leave their armies in the hands of one of the most feared and respected general of the era, Anibal Barcagid. The barcagenians are lords of the seas of Najha and Varsemia, sharing this maritime supremacy with the Confederate City-States of the Varsemian Isles. But, while the later gambled on a merchant focused fleet, Barcagenia has a more homogenous fleet, being well prepared for naval warfare.</p>
                <p>With a strong and sustainable economy, focusing on a vast piscatorial economy and a effective maritime commerce. The barcagenians have a strong trade, relying on their allies, from where they acquire vast quantities of silver, lead, copper e - most important of all - tin, which is used in the majority of the objects in Najha. With a powerful trade allied with a naval fleet capable of envying most nations in the human kingdoms, they garantee the monopoly of this resource in the seas. Barcagenia is also the biggest producer of silver in Najha and Southern Varsemia. They also have an healthy textil business, which includes silks, cotton, linen and wool. They craftsmen are also known for their work with ivory, glass and alabaster. This solid commerce garanties economical growth even in times of war.</p>
                <p>This nation founded a religion that spread mostly through Southern Najha called Mechanism. Consisting in a politheistic pantheon of mechanical deities, with the most popular with the barcagenians being Tarnat, guardian of the barcagenian capital, Barcago, and Bahal Ahmot, her husband and god of fertility and energy. The religious cast has a notorious role in the barcagenian society, acting as advisors and tutors. These also practice sacrifices, asked by the population, that can range from animals to children, thought the sacrificed are always male. Seldomly, the priests organise great feasts in honor of the gods, where everyone dances around big pyres. Calcarian Steles are typical from this nation, erected on the grave of the fallen inside open air sanctuaries.</p>
                <p>The barcagenians have a balanced army, specialized in units that can cover a lot of territory in a short amount of time, thus they train the best scouts in the continent. Not only that, they also focus on light cavalry, light infantry, and a weapon that makes the cretian alliance shake in fear: The najhian great elephants. Thanks to Anibal's supervision, these beasts are trained for combat in any land and are known to be unstoppable, destroying everything unlucky to be on their way.</p>
                <p>On a daily life, barcagenians dress themselves with rich clothing made by their master craftsmen, mostly made of linen, with more expensive materials reserved for the wealthier population. The men own thick and well treated beards, usually adorned with various acessories, like rings. Women like to wear their hair long and braided.</p>
                <p>Diplomatically, they have a solid military alliance with the rubran. They also have good commercial relations with the same nation, from where they import tin and silver. Currently both of them are in an armed conflict known as the "First Cretian-Barcagenian conflict" against the cretian alliance, where they help the southern varsemia resistance against the cretians and directly battle the zancians in Najha.</p>
                <p>Their banner is a woman with her arms open, drawed in red and in a very simple way, on top of her, resides a green eye, observing nonstop, with a with background.</p>
                <p>Since they originally came from the mountains of Salacia, in Varsemia, they belong to the rubran culture.</p>
                <p>A typical barcagenian is 1.60m to 190m tall. Most used dark and long hair, but nobility usually wears short hair. They have dark and intense eyes. The women have light skin color, while the men a bronze color.</p>

                description:`
                <p>When the Cretian Empire invaded Najha, the Muabin had just finished a war with the Chunoi. With morale running low and resources scattered, the Sand Empire asked for help to the neighboring nations, exchanging knowledge, commerce, cultural and religious freedom, and a lifelong alliance. In the northern side of Nahja, the Armatian tribe, a small territory of religious warriors answered and joined the conflict. With the Muabin tutelage these immensely rich with gold, quickly prospered, developed their society and became a strong and united kingdom.</p>
                <p>The holy kingdom of Armatia is young. Their ruler, Mithridates I, has available an army of pious soldiers. From nomadic origins, these warriors are expert in horseback combat and camel warfare. The coordinated devolopment with the Muabin made them true walking fortresses, covering themselves and their mounts with heavy armor, capable of delivering internationally known charges. These cavaliers are known as Cataphracts. Feared by the fear tactics they employ on the defeated, the best known is bathing the defeated in gold. They believe in the purification of the spirit, so bathing the defeated general in gold cleans their souls of greed and ambition. An Armatian known tactic and achievement is being able to use a bow while riding a horse and with their backs towards the animals' head!</p>
                <p>Focusing on a decentralized government, each sector of the kingdom, known as marezas, has a marzban, a guardian. This entity has all the rights of a king in this sector. Above the Marzban presides the "king of kings", Mithridates I. He rules the kingdom in a more abstract way, being responsible for international duty, like diplomacy, commerce and managing the armies. Like the leader before him, he has a polygamous relationship, marrying women from different kingdoms to guaranty an alliance.</p>
                <p>The armatian society is an open one, with it's doors available for several religions. Albeit, the predominant one is the monotheistic religion of Zistranism, the cult of Zistra, which is a local religion. They are also fascinated by other cultures, specially lampa, and they frequently invite artists from these cultures.</p>
                <p>Commercially, the kingdom of Armatia is known to impose taxes on eastern caravans that go towards the rich markets of Varsemia. Particularly, the Minzao empire use the armatian territory to cross their silk and pearl caravans safely to the West. The armatians, besides gold, have a healthy industry of spices, perfumes and a strong agriculture, where they export fruits produced in the region.</p>
                <p>Due to their beliefs, armatians abhor slavery and teach the teachings of Zistra to everyone who's interested. Zistra's Priests, known as magi, are encoraged to be present in the courts of the armatian kings, where they hold functions like alchemists, physicians and astrologers.</p>
                <p>The armatians have a very unique architecture in Najha, resulting in the fusion of the lampa and muabin cultures. They build their structures in marble, using ivory for the details, with the end becoming something very exotic for Najha standards.</p>
                <p>Out of combat, the noble armatians usually wear a gibon and a tunic in a V shaped. Loose but tied up by a belt, with loose pants and a diadem above the hair, carefully combed and cut. Most of the population uses the traditional shirt (qamis), made of delicate and ornamental materials. Women wear mantles with long sleeves above a dress, with necklaces, earings, bracelets and headwear covered by jewels. Their dresses are hold together by a pin in the sholders.</p>
                <p>The Armatian Banner is made of two condors looking towards a star, between them, all painted in brown. With a background in a dark green.</p>
                <p>They belong to the Muabin culture. They have a permanent alliance with them and are currently involved in the War of Northern Nahja, that puts them and their allies against the forces of the Cretian Empire, Zancium and Sephs.</p>
                <p>A typical armatian heights between 1.60m to 1.80m tall. Their men are usually strong, due to the training to withstand the heavy armors. They have bronze skins, dark hair and dark or green eyes.</p>

                description:`
                <p>The Krin are the dominant nation in the area of Istid. They are known for being ferocious warriors, who frequently do raids on the southern and more prosperous regions, where they plunder for riches. They arrive on their long fast boats and spread havok quickly.</p>
                <p>This nation is a warrior nation, stoically defending the North from the threats of the Great Unknown. They live spread out by clans, each governed by a single person, the Jarl, who is always accompanied by the a guard chief, the Housecarl, and a druid.</p>
                <p>Politically, the Kirn live in small clan-states, with each settlement living by their own rules and in an autonomous form. These clan focused settlements aren’t usually big, and are governed by one family, and can shelter up to four or five numerous families.</p>
                <p>There are eight major clans that live in the southern part of the region, where the river Motherflow connects with the Elvhella river. Minor clans and settlements live spread through most of the interior of the region.</p>
                <p>With each clan being autonomous, it’s hard to define a single Krin identity, specially since it’s frequent to see the clans quarrel with each other, with disputes over food supplies, territory or just offenses taken.</p>
                <p>Even with this autonomous rule, all clans still answer to a single person. The best (and sometimes oldest) warrior among the clans, the Fyordheim. Who gets to reside in the fortress of Siebendur. This leader is elected every twenty years through a tournament that unites all the clans together. Besides the Fyordheim there is the Jotun, the master druid, who is handpicked by the Fyordheim.</p>
                <p>Krin education is mostly done by druids, these people teach the young ones the relevance of nature, the influence of the divinities, the art of the hunt and the lesson that a scar carries. Scars are important in Krin society. Someone without scars might be seen as a freshman, or a coward. Someone afraid of battle.</p>
                <p>Young krin develop their martial skils throught hunting and militia service, gaining necessary discipline and coldness with the housecarls.</p>
                <p>Opposite to some societies, the women have an important duty in Krin Society. The housecarl might be the guard chief of the clan, but all families have a household leader, someone responsible for the security of the family, The Skaldmaer, who is always female. It’s frequent to see women fight side by side with men in the battlefield.</p>
                <p>Due to the strong unforgiving presence of nature around them, Krin feel connected to it, being frequent to see druids, hunters and rangers defending their wilder lands. Fighters and Barbarians make the bulk of a Krin army, with their soldiers favouring axes, both in melee and as a throwing weapon.</p>
                <p>While in more developed societies bards have their fare share of trade, Krin bards are exceptional motivators, inciting their kin to fits of rage in the battlefield. These Krin bards are known as Skalds and are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
                <p>Krin worship their own polytheistic pantheon. When a Krin feels his time as come, he embarks on a journey North, passing the lookout points in the edge of the territory and becomes an hermit in the Great Unknown, living there his remaining days. “To die defending the land that I leave to my progeny.” is a common sentence to them that shows well this tradition.</p>
                <p>Krin normally are quite tall, going from 1.80m to 2.10m high. They are strong and robust with rosed or pale skin and usually long and wild blonde hair, with blue or green eyes.</p>

                <p>The Tatamak, also known as Icefarers, are an indigenous people that live on the Western coast of Istid, next to the Great Sea of Ice.</p>
                <p>They have a fairly simple social structure, living in families, a bit like the Krin, but less numerous.</p>
                <p>These people usually live in tipis made of pelts and bones of big game animals, like the mammoth.</p>
                <p>The leader of the family, by norm the father, is known as Inui. He is the coordinator of the hunt, be it on land or sea, and of the tribe's defense.</p>
                <p>In this society gender is meaningless. All work for the common goal of the survival and flourish of the tribe.</p>
                <p>The Tatamak are very versatile people. They have a strong instinct for survival and, even though they are more considered an ethnic group rather than a nation, they defend themselves in a cohesive and professional way.</p>
                <p>These Icefarers have a rudimentary economy. Due to the inhospitable land where they live, it is difficult to create a sustaining agriculture.</p>
                <p>Since they can't toil the land, they turned to the seas. These masters of survival became master fishermen. Whales and walrus are hunted with care. It's meat stored in ice and salt and used to fed the rigorous winters. The animals fat is used as fuel for the fires, to warm the bones both inside and outside the tipis.</p>
                <p>They aren't just sea hunters though. Inland they have become expert big game hunters. Their prey is mostly megafauna, which lives abundantly in Istid.</p>
                <p>The Tatamak don't just hunt prey for food. They also train them. Using all kinds of megafauna to help them on daily tasks.</p>
                <p>Due to their expertise, these people have an carefully planned international trade where furs, animal oil, and bonecrafts give them a boost on their economy.</p>
                <p>Living in a rather self-preserving tribal society, they are mostly illeterate. Their tradition and beliefs passed down from generation to generation orally, through the families elders.</p>
                <p>Education for a tatamak is very practical. They are taught how to hunt, how to fight, how to use the animals and it's materials. Essentially, how to survive.</p>
                <p>The Icefarers of Istid don't have a practical religion. Instead, they have strongly built folklore, based on ancestry, spirits, and mother earth, which defines their morals. These morals are passed by the shamans, known as angakkuq, who usually are the elders of the tribe.</p>
                <p>Besides the father, Inui, and the shaman, Angakkuq, the oracle, known as Loq'ash, also plays an important role in their society. He sees future events through bone scrying. Many are the families that act according to these oracles visions.</p>
                <p>These people are one of the most pacific and united ethnic groups in all human lands. Even though they don't take part of the political scene of the continent and their social structure limits their potential, they don't quarrel between each family. In fact, they help each other regularly.</p>
                <p>Life is simple for a tatamak. They need to survive the Winter. And winter is eternal in Istid, so petty quarrels have no space for them.</p>
                <p>Tatamak warfare is a clever one. They boldly face enemies bigger and stronger then them, but their cooperation prevails. Their weapons might be rudimentary, mostly made of animal bones, but on their hands are powerful tools.</p>
                <p>Due to their unity, it's common to see a whole family trying to hunt big game animals, using cooperation, numbers and the landscape to their advantage.</p>
                <p>The indigenous folk have a healthy relationship with the Maoquinas, due to the similar creeds, and both usually help each other. The Krin also respect and valor these folks. Having a commercial agreement with them, prizing their whale oil.</p>
                <p>The dog is a tatamaks best friend. They use them to move their sleds through Istid, to help them in their hunt and to control the shepparded animals.</p>
                <p>Tatamaks are usually small, heighting from 1.40 to 1.60 metres tall. They are robust and stocky, with a pale bronze skin, dark hair and dark, slanted eyes. They use thick furs as clothing are easily recognized by their bone weapons.</p>

                <p>In the region of West Varsemia, near the Nakolotan border, the Kaastians live. A nation that inhabits in a network of canals and rivers, prospering and dominating the continent's commerce.</p>
                <p>The Kaastians are a diverse nation with focus on trade, doing business often with most of the nations. Currency was added in the continent by them and the various gold deposits, scattered throught the region, helped them become a strong power in the human kingdoms.</p>
                <p>This nation is ruled by an oligarchic counsil known as "Vermogend". This is made of ten people, each one a representative, a duke, of each of the most wealthy families in the nation. They discuss politics and commerce. Alas, This counsil works more as a symbol of power, making laws for the nations economical well being and not much else. The true power is in the families. Each family controls parcels of the cities, having complete jurisdiction inside these. The streets are patrolled by family owned guards and the kaastian army is no more than mercenary companies employed by wealthy merchants.</p>
                <p>In a society where the rich hold most of the power, the families fight and conspire between them, constantly searching for ways of weakening their rivals, in a unending game of intrigue and power. Their courts are avid of intrigue and conspiracy and their spies infamous throught all the land. Life in the court for a kaastian is very important and the kaastians believe that whoever holds the most knowledge, is the most powerful. And with the wealth generated by the commerce, the different houses are always trying to get the upper part of the deal in a neverending spyonage battle.</p>
                <p>The art of gunpowder, stolen from the Muabin, has long since been perfected by their engineers and academics and these "River Foxes" (how they are known throught the region) developed their firearms way smaller then the Muab Muskets. Today, these weapons, pistols, are part of the equipment of any soldier of spy.</p>
                <p>Military wise, the Kaastians prefer freedom of movement and coordination. Using practical light armor in battle. A typical kaastian soldier doesn't use more than a studded leather or a simple breastplate, an halberd, a rapier, two pistols and a pouch with ammunition.</p>
                <p>Religiously, this nation worships one entity, "The One God", Klaar. They see this being as a savior and redemptor of their people. In his temples, the poor are sheltered and taught. their priests spread the word and faith by the remaining kingdoms and it's frequent to see Klaar missionaries in other regions. The dukes themselves, family leaders, are zealous worshipers and work obsessively for the divine favour of their god.</p>
                <p>Due to the nations high commercial capacity, the kaastians harbour plenty of iluminated people from all the continent, from diverse cultural fields. Each court with a wide range of sages from different origins, training and improving the minds of their hired family, pushing for perfection the knowledge of the houses. This makes the Kaastians, especially the richest houses, some of the most culturally advanced in all the continent.</p>
                <p>Master of commerce, they keep wonderful diplomatic (and economical) relations with the Rubran, and good relationships in general with the rest of the nations in Varsemia. The canals and rivers that they dominate are stratigically good for, if the need arises, to stablish commercial deals with remote regions. Thus, there are commercial outposts positioned cleverly throught most of the continent, strengthning a house's power in the region. Nakolota is a good example of this. The kaastians are currently trying to explore the regions resources, much to the locals anger.</p>
                <p>Currently, the ten wealthiest families are: Van Orange, di Giobarti, de la Veja, der Fugger, da Gama, du Pont, de Burgos, of Tamzin, iz Morozov, and av Bender. Each family specializes in a particular field and has a distinctive fighting style and architecture.</p>
                <p>A typical kaastian measures between 1,70m to 2,10m tall. They are usually tall and slim, with hair normally light coloured, from light brown to pure blonde, using short hairstyles but extravagant and well groomed facial hairstyles. Their eyes are likewise light. They like to wear the colours that represent their houses.</p>`,

                <p>In the region of West Varsemia, near the Nakolotan border, the Kaastians live. A nation that inhabits in a network of canals and rivers, prospering and dominating the continent's commerce.</p>
                <p>The Kaastians are a diverse nation with focus on trade, doing business often with most of the nations. Currency was added in the continent by them and the various gold deposits, scattered throught the region, helped them become a strong power in the human kingdoms.</p>
                <p>This nation is ruled by an oligarchic counsil known as "Vermogend". This is made of ten people, each one a representative, a duke, of each of the most wealthy families in the nation. They discuss politics and commerce. Alas, This counsil works more as a symbol of power, making laws for the nations economical well being and not much else. The true power is in the families. Each family controls parcels of the cities, having complete jurisdiction inside these. The streets are patrolled by family owned guards and the kaastian army is no more than mercenary companies employed by wealthy merchants.</p>
                <p>In a society where the rich hold most of the power, the families fight and conspire between them, constantly searching for ways of weakening their rivals, in a unending game of intrigue and power. Their courts are avid of intrigue and conspiracy and their spies infamous throught all the land. Life in the court for a kaastian is very important and the kaastians believe that whoever holds the most knowledge, is the most powerful. And with the wealth generated by the commerce, the different houses are always trying to get the upper part of the deal in a neverending spyonage battle.</p>
                <p>The art of gunpowder, stolen from the Muabin, has long since been perfected by their engineers and academics and these "River Foxes" (how they are known throught the region) developed their firearms way smaller then the Muab Muskets. Today, these weapons, pistols, are part of the equipment of any soldier of spy.</p>
                <p>Military wise, the Kaastians prefer freedom of movement and coordination. Using practical light armor in battle. A typical kaastian soldier doesn't use more than a studded leather or a simple breastplate, an halberd, a rapier, two pistols and a pouch with ammunition.</p>
                <p>Religiously, this nation worships one entity, "The One God", Klaar. They see this being as a savior and redemptor of their people. In his temples, the poor are sheltered and taught. their priests spread the word and faith by the remaining kingdoms and it's frequent to see Klaar missionaries in other regions. The dukes themselves, family leaders, are zealous worshipers and work obsessively for the divine favour of their god.</p>
                <p>Due to the nations high commercial capacity, the kaastians harbour plenty of iluminated people from all the continent, from diverse cultural fields. Each court with a wide range of sages from different origins, training and improving the minds of their hired family, pushing for perfection the knowledge of the houses. This makes the Kaastians, especially the richest houses, some of the most culturally advanced in all the continent.</p>
                <p>Master of commerce, they keep wonderful diplomatic (and economical) relations with the Rubran, and good relationships in general with the rest of the nations in Varsemia. The canals and rivers that they dominate are stratigically good for, if the need arises, to stablish commercial deals with remote regions. Thus, there are commercial outposts positioned cleverly throught most of the continent, strengthning a house's power in the region. Nakolota is a good example of this. The kaastians are currently trying to explore the regions resources, much to the locals anger.</p>
                <p>Currently, the ten wealthiest families are: Van Orange, di Giobarti, de la Veja, der Fugger, da Gama, du Pont, de Burgos, of Tamzin, iz Morozov, and av Bender. Each family specializes in a particular field and has a distinctive fighting style and architecture.</p>
                <p>A typical kaastian measures between 1,70m to 2,10m tall. They are usually tall and slim, with hair normally light coloured, from light brown to pure blonde, using short hairstyles but extravagant and well groomed facial hairstyles.

                description:`
                <p>In the lush jungles of Quetza there once existed a xenophobic, cruel empire. Isolated from the rest of the human kingdoms for millenia. The Quepa-Qual was known through all the continent as a vast empire of pernicious humans that used their prisoners not only in savage games of survival, but also in mass sacrifices to gods, on top of their blood covered pyramids.</p>
                <p>The empire was feared, not just by their size and strength, but also for their cunning and tenacity. Such an empire lived untouched and unscathed from outside influences since it's foundation, somewhere during the Age of Arrivals. All that changed with the Great Deluge.</p>
                <p>The Great Deluge shook the empire's core to it's deepest and with unforeseen consequences. The floods and the earthquakes brought hunger and plague that desolated the quetzan territory. Tens of thousands of people died in plain streets of the empires biggest cities. The capital, Zapotecla, saw part of it being swallowed by the river Nekh'Phal. A scar of those times for eternity.</p>
                <p>The moral of the citizens was engulfed in flames and the low class and military finally burst against the noble hierarchy, thus beginning the War of the Triangle, also known as the Quetzan Civil War, disputed, as the name implies, by three fronts.</p>
                <p>As time passed by, and the war dragging itself, the once united Empire was no more and three nations rose up from it's ashes. Young nations of old blood, thirsty to carve their name into the world and bring once again glory to Quetza.</p>
                <p>These nations, of Quepatec culture, share most of the old empire's traits. The new nations work around these massive city-states, true metropolis (altepetl), and their surroundings (calpulli). The leader of each nation is known as the Calpuleh.</p>
                <p>In society, they are divided into nobles (pipiltin) and common folk (macehualtin) and insde theses there is an elaborate hierarchy of social status, responsabilities and power. Interesting fact is that any common folk can achieve through merit to a lower noble position. a long distance merchant (pochtecah) is a good example of this. Their economy is based on agriculture, pillage, and commerce, now finally open to the rest of the human nations, and their mining of gold and marble. Each nation specialized itself on a different craft.</p>
                <p>Education is mandatory to everyone until their fifteenth summer, taugh by their parents and the local priest. The next five summers, young ones go to two different schools: Telpochcalli, the House of Young Ones, where they are taught history, religion, combat, commerce and craft. And Calmelac, the House of Knowledge, dedicated to noble teens. Here they are molded into leaders (tlatoque), priests and scholars (tlatimini), healers (tizitl) and judges (tlacuilos), with areas covering calligraphy, astronomy, administration, theology among others.</p>
                <p>A polytheistic culture with their own pantheon, priests and scholars are seen with utmost respect and take a very strict life: cold baths in the morning, intense physical training, resistance tests, and self-flagellation produce an extremely stoic social class.</p>
                <p>Even though these hard folk still have a conservative society, they are determined to clean their image to the rest of the continent.</p>
                <p>In battle, each new nation of Quetza has their own tactics, but all are strong with the atlatl, a mechanism to throw dards and javelins longer, and the maquahuitl, a serrated thick sword, usually made of wood, stone, or both.</p>

                <p>In the lush jungles of Quetza there once existed a xenophobic, cruel empire. Isolated from the rest of the human kingdoms for millenia. The Quepa-Qual was known through all the continent as a vast empire of pernicious humans that used their prisoners not only in savage games of survival, but also in mass sacrifices to gods, on top of their blood covered pyramids.</p>
                <p>The empire was feared, not just by their size and strength, but also for their cunning and tenacity. Such an empire lived untouched and unscathed from outside influences since it's foundation, somewhere during the Age of Arrivals. All that changed with the Great Deluge.</p>
                <p>The Great Deluge shook the empire's core to it's deepest and with unforeseen consequences. The floods and the earthquakes brought hunger and plague that desolated the quetzan territory. Tens of thousands of people died in plain streets of the empires biggest cities. The capital, Zapotecla, saw part of it being swallowed by the river Nekh'Phal. A scar of those times for eternity.</p>
                <p>The moral of the citizens was engulfed in flames and the low class and military finally burst against the noble hierarchy, thus beginning the War of the Triangle, also known as the Quetzan Civil War, disputed, as the name implies, by three fronts.</p>
                <p>As time passed by, and the war dragging itself, the once united Empire was no more and three nations rose up from it's ashes. Young nations of old blood, thirsty to carve their name into the world and bring once again glory to Quetza.</p>

                <p>In society, they are divided into nobles (pipiltin) and common folk (macehualtin) and insde theses there is an elaborate hierarchy of social status, responsabilities and power. Interesting fact is that any common folk can achieve through merit to a lower noble position. a long distance merchant (pochtecah) is a good example of this. Their economy is based on agriculture, pillage, and commerce, now finally open to the rest of the human nations, and their mining of gold and marble. Each nation specialized itself on a different craft.</p>
                <p>Education is mandatory to everyone until their fifteenth summer, taugh by their parents and the local priest. The next five summers, young ones go to two different schools: Telpochcalli, the House of Young Ones, where they are taught history, religion, combat, commerce and craft. And Calmelac, the House of Knowledge, dedicated to noble teens. Here they are molded into leaders (tlatoque), priests and scholars (tlatimini), healers (tizitl) and judges (tlacuilos), with areas covering calligraphy, astronomy, administration, theology among others.</p>
                <p>A polytheistic culture with their own pantheon, priests and scholars are seen with utmost respect and take a very strict life: cold baths in the morning, intense physical training, resistance tests, and self-flagellation produce an extremely stoic social class.</p>

                <p>In battle, each new nation of Quetza has their own tactics, but all are strong with the atlatl, a mechanism to throw dards and javelins longer, and the maquahuitl, a serrated thick sword, usually made of wood, stone, or both.</p>

                <p>The Lao-Tse are one of the most enimagtic humans in Arthan Uthyl. Moved by honor and an conduit of extreme obedience to their superiors. The Lao-Tse worship only one god: Their own emperor.</p>
                <p>The emperor is hereditarily succeeded, but lives way more than a normal human, which turns him into an immortal for human eyes. No one knowns why this happens. The current emperor is Gohzien Tse the IV, the Eternal, and succeeded his antecessor more then a hundred springs ago.</p>
                <p>Directly linked with the emperor's life longevity, the Lao-Tse society lives in a gerontocratic system, thus, the old ones rule.</p>
                <p>There are two great social classes in this society: the samurai and the mob. The samurai are nobles, generals and warlords (daimyos), belonging to powerful clans and holders of some land. They always have a daishyo, which is their nobility symbol and consists of a katana and wakizachi. They follow the code of honor known as the bushido. To be easily recognisable, they usually dress with the color patterns and heraldry of their clan.</p>
                <p>The mob consists of any clanless person, this includes the merchant and artisan castes.</p>
                <p>This society is extremely patriarchical and, as a consequence to this, chauvinist. Women are seen with respect in some roles, like a courtier, but they options and freedom are quite restricted.</p>
                <p>Some women achieve the rare feat of entering the military. For this rare thing to happen, she must be related to a noble and be taught the diverse martial arts and learned the bushido code. A successful woman in this field gets the title of Onna-bugeisha. A great distinction that gives the title holder a place of power in her clan.</p>
                <p>The geography of this nation is divided by clans. Each microregion is governed by a clan. It consists of a numerous, wealthy family of noblemen, with an education above the mob.</p>
                <p>The Lao-Tse are a very disciplined nation. This, allied with good physical resistance and extreme martial tradition makes them a well respected folk in the field of battle. Their weapons are forged with immense precision and their warriors are known to use them in deadly and clinical strokes.</p>
                <p>This nation doesn't fight just with weapons. Known to have a strong unarmed fighting tradition, their most pious warriors reject the use of weapons, treating their fists as a hammer, spear, and blade, with deadly efficiency.</p>
                <p>Just like the Minzao, their rivals, the Lao-Tse also have a tradition of warrior monks and their monks are known for being fearless and powerful in battle.</p>
                <p>The Lao-Tse build their houses, forts and palaces in jagged cliffs, making their cities true wonders of engineering. Their artisans are respected internationally, specially painters and weaponsmiths.</p>
                <p>Economically, they have difficulty living from agriculture, due to the highly unleveled and montainous terrain. Still, their earth is rich in minerals, making the few patches of agriculture quite efficient. They mainly harvest rice, making most of their fields near the Inland Sea, to the East. The margins of the sea is extensively used for fishing, making them one of the nations that most consumes fish in their diet.</p>
                <p>Education is quite strict in this region. Due to its harsh environment, since childhood, everyone is trained to develop a strong will, making them very "do or die" characters. The art of war is omnipresent in their education. The young ones are taught how to manage several weapons, but also how to be good tacticians.</p>
                <p>As hobbies, everyone is encouraged to practice painting and sculpture. This arts are seen as ways of reaching harmony of spirit and balances the heavy warlike discipline.</p>
                <p>Their main rivals are the Minzao and the Ulnuc. They have good relations with the Rubran, Meynari and Kaastians, all of whom they have commercial agreements. They have a mutual alliance with the meynari.</p>
                <p>A Lao-Tse has between 1.60m and 1.80m tall, dark hair, and slanted eyes. Their skin tone goes from bronze to pure white. Noblemen usually have a ponytail tied on top of their head, while mob usually have their hair shaved on the sides. Women are quite vain and use a lot of make-up, flowered clothing and prepped up hair.</p>

                <p>The Minzao are an extremely methodic and practical nation. A great share of the human kingdom's brightest minds comes from here, from philosophers to mathmaticians, biologists, astronomers, etc. They are a nation that likes to show intelectual superiority.</p>
                <p>This country is a very populated nation, if not the most populated in the human kingdom, and the only reason why they don't control the rest of the continent is due to their armies lacking discipline. A technological achievement for them was to invent the crossbow, who anyone can be taught to wield. More importantly though is their mastery over the arcane, something that was almost lost in the human kingdoms and their school of magic is unique. Such mastery made them famous, and feared, for using evokers to bombard enemy lines.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the protectorate practice the eastern tradition of the unharmed fighting priests. These warriors, known as warrior monks, are capable of extraordinary feats.</p>
                <p>The minzao protect to extreme lenghts their arcane knowledge. Reserving it solely to citizens of the protectorate. Despite this, they aren't the only nation capable of using arcane arts. They see such foreign practice with immense suspition, and due to the inumerous incidents that happened in the continent's history, they created an international police to combat arcane terror, the Shenmi de Liquan, the Arcane Hounds. These men will investigate any incident that involves magic or something similar, and will cease it as quick as possible.</p>
                <p>Politically formed by big fieves, that inside are divided by smaller ones, and inside of these once again divided into small settlements. Each big fief has a court made by the leaders of the smaller fieves of the region. These leader are, most of the times, sages or academics of the community. Between the members of the courts, Shen Long, the ancient dragon, picks one to be the maximum representative of the region and keep this position for five years.</p>
                <p>Socially, they divide themselves in three classes (academics, military and mob) where there is little flexibility between each other. The academics can marry with military and mob can join the army. This way, the nation secures a lot of manpower. The mob are the artisans and merchants, that drive the economy.</p>
                <p>The minzao worship one being, the dragon Shen Long, and believe in a set of moral codes, that are passed each generation through the elders of the region. Education is seen as something of the utmost importance.</p>
                <p>It's very difficult to enter in the region of Chientzu, the minzao homeland. The territory is surrounded by a network of high walls that protect them from outsiders. They naturally dislike seeing foreigners in their territory. Despite this, they have diplomats in every kingdom.</p>
                <p>The minzao have good diplomatic relations with te muabin, who sell minzao's silks, porcelain and jade throught the Varsemian civilizations. They have bad blood with ulnucs and lao-tse though.</p>
                <p>A minzao is between 1.80m to 2.00m tall. They have dark hair and slanted eyes. Their skin tone is palish, and they like to have long pointy nails and long and thin moustaches and goaties. Their clothes consists of monocolored silk robes.</p>

                <p>In the region of West Varsemia, near the Nakolotan border, the Kaastians live. A nation that inhabits in a network of canals and rivers, prospering and dominating the continent's commerce.</p>
                <p>The Kaastians are a diverse nation with focus on trade, doing business often with most of the nations. Currency was added in the continent by them and the various gold deposits, scattered throught the region, helped them become a strong power in the human kingdoms.</p>
                <p>This nation is ruled by an oligarchic counsil known as "Vermogend". This is made of ten people, each one a representative, a duke, of each of the most wealthy families in the nation. They discuss politics and commerce. Alas, This counsil works more as a symbol of power, making laws for the nations economical well being and not much else. The true power is in the families. Each family controls parcels of the cities, having complete jurisdiction inside these. The streets are patrolled by family owned guards and the kaastian army is no more than mercenary companies employed by wealthy merchants.</p>
                <p>In a society where the rich hold most of the power, the families fight and conspire between them, constantly searching for ways of weakening their rivals, in a unending game of intrigue and power. Their courts are avid of intrigue and conspiracy and their spies infamous throught all the land. Life in the court for a kaastian is very important and the kaastians believe that whoever holds the most knowledge, is the most powerful. And with the wealth generated by the commerce, the different houses are always trying to get the upper part of the deal in a neverending spyonage battle.</p>
                <p>The art of gunpowder, stolen from the Muabin, has long since been perfected by their engineers and academics and these "River Foxes" (how they are known throught the region) developed their firearms way smaller then the Muab Muskets. Today, these weapons, pistols, are part of the equipment of any soldier of spy.</p>
                <p>Military wise, the Kaastians prefer freedom of movement and coordination. Using practical light armor in battle. A typical kaastian soldier doesn't use more than a studded leather or a simple breastplate, an halberd, a rapier, two pistols and a pouch with ammunition.</p>
                <p>Religiously, this nation worships one entity, "The One God", Klaar. They see this being as a savior and redemptor of their people. In his temples, the poor are sheltered and taught. their priests spread the word and faith by the remaining kingdoms and it's frequent to see Klaar missionaries in other regions. The dukes themselves, family leaders, are zealous worshipers and work obsessively for the divine favour of their god.</p>
                <p>Due to the nations high commercial capacity, the kaastians harbour plenty of iluminated people from all the continent, from diverse cultural fields. Each court with a wide range of sages from different origins, training and improving the minds of their hired family, pushing for perfection the knowledge of the houses. This makes the Kaastians, especially the richest houses, some of the most culturally advanced in all the continent.</p>
                <p>Master of commerce, they keep wonderful diplomatic (and economical) relations with the Rubran, and good relationships in general with the rest of the nations in Varsemia. The canals and rivers that they dominate are stratigically good for, if the need arises, to stablish commercial deals with remote regions. Thus, there are commercial outposts positioned cleverly throught most of the continent, strengthning a house's power in the region. Nakolota is a good example of this. The kaastians are currently trying to explore the regions resources, much to the locals anger.</p>
                <p>Currently, the ten wealthiest families are: Van Orange, di Giobarti, de la Veja, der Fugger, da Gama, du Pont, de Burgos, of Tamzin, iz Morozov, and av Bender. Each family specializes in a particular field and has a distinctive fighting style and architecture.</p>
                <p>A typical kaastian measures between 1,70m to 2,10m tall. They are usually tall and slim, with hair normally light coloured, from light brown to pure blonde, using short hairstyles but extravagant and well groomed facial hairstyles. Their eyes are likewise light. They like to wear the colours that represent their houses.</p>`,

This is made of ten people, each one a representative, a duke, of each of the most wealthy families in the nation. They discuss politics and commerce. Alas, This counsil works more as a symbol of power, making laws for the nations economical well being and not much else. The true power is in the families. Each family controls parcels of the cities, having complete jurisdiction inside these. The streets are patrolled by family owned guards and the kaastian army is no more than mercenary companies employed by wealthy merchants.</p>
                <p>In a society where the rich hold most of the power, the families fight and conspire between them, constantly searching for ways of weakening their rivals, in a unending game of intrigue and power. Their courts are avid of intrigue and conspiracy and their spies infamous throught all the land. Life in the court for a kaastian is very important and the kaastians believe that whoever holds the most knowledge, is the most powerful. And with the wealth generated by the commerce, the different houses are always trying to get the upper part of the deal in a neverending spyonage battle.</p>
                <p>The art of gunpowder, stolen from the Muabin, has long since been perfected by their engineers and academics and these "River Foxes" (how they are known throught the region) developed their firearms way smaller then the Muab Muskets. Today, these weapons, pistols, are part of the equipment of any soldier of spy.</p>
                <p>Military wise, the Kaastians prefer freedom of movement and coordination. Using practical light armor in battle. A typical kaastian soldier doesn't use more than a studded leather or a simple breastplate, an halberd, a rapier, two pistols and a pouch with ammunition.</p>
                <p>Religiously, this nation worships one entity, "The One God", Klaar. They see this being as a savior and redemptor of their people. In his temples, the poor are sheltered and taught. their priests spread the word and faith by the remaining kingdoms and it's frequent to see Klaar missionaries in other regions. The dukes themselves, family leaders, are zealous worshipers and work obsessively for the divine favour of their god.</p>
                <p>Due to the nations high commercial capacity, the kaastians harbour plenty of iluminated people from all the continent, from diverse cultural fields. Each court with a wide range of sages from different origins, training and improving the minds of their hired family, pushing for perfection the knowledge of the houses. This makes the Kaastians, especially the richest houses, some of the most culturally advanced in all the continent.</p>
                <p>Master of commerce, they keep wonderful diplomatic (and economical) relations with the Rubran, and good relationships in general with the rest of the nations in Varsemia. The canals and rivers that they dominate are stratigically good for, if the need arises, to stablish commercial deals with remote regions. Thus, there are commercial outposts positioned cleverly throught most of the continent, strengthning a house's power in the region. Nakolota is a good example of this. The kaastians are currently trying to explore the regions resources, much to the locals anger.</p>
                <p>Currently, the ten wealthiest families are: Van Orange, di Giobarti, de la Veja, der Fugger, da Gama, du Pont, de Burgos, of Tamzin, iz Morozov, and av Bender. Each family specializes in a particular field and has a distinctive fighting style and architecture.</p>
                <p>A typical kaastian measures between 1,70m to 2,10m tall. They are usually tall and slim, with hair normally light coloured, from light brown to pure blonde, using short hairstyles but extravagant and well groomed facial hairstyles.
